Suppose that 8\% of the patients tested in a clinic are infected with HIV.
Furthermore, suppose that when a blood test for HIV is given, 98\% of the patients infected with HIV test positive and that 3\% of the patients not infected with HIV test positive.
What is the probability that
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item a patient testing positive for HIV with this test is infected with it?
	\item a patient testing positive for HIV with this test is not infected with it?
	\item a patient testing negative for HIV with this test is infected with it?
	\item a patient testing negative for HIV with this test is not infected with it?
\end{enumerate}

\solution
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item 
	\item 
	\item 
	\item 
\end{enumerate}
