\problem{3}
Suppose that Frida selects a ball by first picking one of two boxes at random and then selecting a ball from this box at random.
The first box contains two white balls and three blue balls, and the second box contains four white balls and one blue ball.
What is the probability that Frida picked a ball from the first box if she has selected a blue ball?

\solution

Let $A$ be the event that Frida selected a blue ball and let $B$ be the event that she picked a ball from the first box.
From the problem statement we have $p(A) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{5} = 2/5$, $p(B) = 1/2$ and $p(A|B) = 3/5$. Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem
to get $p(B|A)$.

\[ p(B|A) = \frac{(3/5)(1/2)}{2/5} = 3/4 \]
