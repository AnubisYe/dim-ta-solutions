\problem{28}
Assume that the probability a child is a boy is 0.51 and that the sexes of children born into a family are independent.
What is the probability that a family of five children has
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item exactly three boys?
	\item at least one boy?
	\item at least one girl?
	\item all children of the same sex?
\end{enumerate}

\solution
For this problem, we model the bearing of children as a Bernoulli trial where---as controversial as it may seem---success is having a boy.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item $C(5, 1)(0.51)^1(0.49)^4$
	\item $1 - C(5, 0)(0.51)^0(0.49)^5 = 1 - 0.49^5$
	\item $1 - C(5, 5)(0.51)^5(0.49)^0 = 1 - 0.51^5$
	\item $C(5, 0)(0.51)^0(0.49)^5 + C(5, 5)(0.51)^5(0.49)^0 = 0.49^5 + 0.51^5$
\end{enumerate}
