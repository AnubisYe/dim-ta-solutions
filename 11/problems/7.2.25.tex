\problem{25}
What is the conditional probability that a randomly generated bit string of length four contains at least two consecutive 0s, given that the first bit is a 1?
(Assume the probabilities of a 0 and a 1 are the same.)

\solution
Let $p(E)$ and $p(F)$ be the respective probabilities.
Then
\[
	E = \{0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 1000, 1001, 1100\}
\]
\[
	F = \{1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111\}
\]
\[
	E \cup F = \{1000, 1001, 1100\}
\]
So
\[
p(E|F) = p(E \cup F)/p(F) = 3/8.
\]
