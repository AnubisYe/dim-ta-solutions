\problem{5}
A pair of dice is loaded.
The probability that a 4 appears on the first die is 2/7, and the probability that a 3 appears on the second die is 2/7.
Other outcomes for each die appear with probability 1/7.
What is the probability of 7 appearing as the sum of the numbers when the two dice are rolled?

\solution
As with a pair of fair dice, the sample space has 36 outcomes.
Those six having a sum of 7 each have $(1/7)(1/7)$ probability bar the outcome where 4 appears on the first die and a 3 appears on the second die;
it has probability of $(2/7)(2/7)$.
We conclude that the probability of 7 appearing as the sum of the numbers on these loaded dice is the sum of those probabilities: $9/49$.
