\problem{29}
A group of six people play the game of ``odd person out'' to determine who will buy refreshments.
Each person flips a fair coin.
If there is a person whose outcome is not the same as that of any other member of the group, this person has to buy the refreshments.
What is the probability that there is an odd person out after the coins are flipped once?
