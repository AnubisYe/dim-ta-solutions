\problem{7}
The final exam of a discrete mathematics course consists of 50 true/false questions, each worth two points, and 25 multiple-choice questions, each worth four points.
The probability that Linda answers a true/false question correctly is 0.9, and the probability that she answers a multiple-choice question correctly is 0.8.
What is her expected score on the final?

\solution

\[ 2 \cdot 50 \cdot 0.9 + 4 \cdot 25 \cdot 0.8 = 170 \]
