\problem{23}
What is the conditional probability that exactly four heads appear when a fair coin is flipped five times, given that the first flip came up heads?

\solution
These flips are a independent Bernoulli trials.
By Theorem 2, the probability of three successes in the remaining four trials/flips (and thus the probability of four heads appearing) is
\(
	C(4, 3)(1/2)^3(1/2)^1 = 4(1/2)^4 = 1/4.
