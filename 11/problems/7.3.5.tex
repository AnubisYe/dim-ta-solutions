\problem{5}
Suppose that 8\% of all bicycle racers use steroids, that a bicyclist who uses steroids tests positive for steroids 96\% of the time, and that a bicyclist who does not use steroids tests positive for steroids 9\% of the time.
What is the probability that a randomly selected bicyclist who tests positive for steroids actually uses steroids?
