\problem{5}
Suppose that 8\% of all bicycle racers use steroids, that a bicyclist who uses steroids tests positive for steroids 96\% of the time, and that a bicyclist who does not use steroids tests positive for steroids 9\% of the time.
What is the probability that a randomly selected bicyclist who tests positive for steroids actually uses steroids?

\solution

Let $A$ be the event that a randomly selected bicyclist uses steroids and $+$ be the event that a bicyclist tests positive for steroids.
From the problem description we have that $p(A) = 0.08$, $p(+) = 0.08\cdot 0.96 + (1-0.08)\cdot 0.09 = 0.1596$ and $p(+|A) = 0.96$.
Apply Bayes' Theorem and we get
\[ p(A|+) = \frac{0.96 \cdot 0.08}{0.1596} = 0.481 \]
