\problem{1}
What probability should be assigned to the outcome of heads when a biased coin is tossed, if heads is three times as likely to come up as tails?
What probability should be assigned to the outcome of tails?

\solution
We have
\(
	p(H) = 3p(T).
\)
Because
\(
	p(H) + p(T) = 1,
\)
it follows that
\(
	3p(T) + p(T) = 4p(T) = 1.
\)
We conclude that
\(
	p(T) = 1/4
\)
and
\(
	p(H) = 3/4.
\)
