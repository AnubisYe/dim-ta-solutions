\problem{14}
Find the inverse of the shear transformation in Example 4 and describe it geometrically.

\solution
Since the shear adds a scalar multiple of the $y$ component to the $x$ component, its inverse subtracts that same scalar multiple; i.e., the inverse of a positive shear is a negative shear by the same scalar, and vice versa.
