\problem{4}
If $a > 0$ is a fixed real number, define $T: \RR^n \to \RR^n$ by $T(X) = aX$ for all $X$ in $R^n$. Show that $T$ is a linear transformation, and find its matrix. [$T$ is called a \emph{dilation} if $a > 0$, and a \emph{contraction} if $a < 0$].

\solution
Let $A$ and $B$ be vectors in $\RR^n$ and $b$ a scalar. Then $T$ preserves both addition
\[
	T(A + B) = a(A + B) = aA + aB = T(A) + T(B)
\]
and scalar multiplication
\[
	T(bA) = abA = baA = bT(A)
\]
and is thus a linear transformation whose matrix is $aI_n$.
