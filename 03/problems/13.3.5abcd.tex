\problem{5}
Describe the elements of the set $A^\ast$ for these values of $A$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item $\{10\}$
	\item $\{111\}$
	\item $\{0, 01\}$
	\item $\{1, 101\}$
\end{enumerate}

\solution
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The set of all bit strings consisting of zero or more repetitions of $10$.
	\item The set of all bit strings consisting of zero or more repetitions of $111$; or equivalently, the set of all bit strings containing only $1$s and having length divisible by $3$.
	\item The set of all bit strings where a $1$ is always preceded by a $0$.
	\item The set of all bit strings that start and end with $1$s and have at least two $1$s between each pair of $0$s.
\end{enumerate}
