\problem{7}
	Show that if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime positive integers,
	then the inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ is unique modulo $m$.
	[Hint: Assume that there are two solutions $b$ and $c$ of the congruence $ax \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$.
	Use Theorem 7 of Section 4.3 to show that $b \equiv c \pmod{m}$.]
