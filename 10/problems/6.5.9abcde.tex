\problem{9}
A bagel shop has onion bagels, poppy seed bagels, egg bagels, salty bagels, pumpernickel bagels, sesame seed bagels, raisin bagels, and plain bagels.
How many ways are there to choose
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item six bagels?
	\item a dozen bagels?
	\item two dozen bagels?
	\item a dozen bagels with at least one of each kind?
	\item a dozen bagels with at least three egg bagels and no more than two salty bagels?
\end{enumerate}

\solution
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Using Theorem 2 we have that this equals to $C(8+6-1, 6) = 1716$ 
	\item Using Theorem 2 again we have that this equals to $$C(8+12-1, 12) = 50388$$
	\item Again we use Theorem 2 to get $C(8+24-1, 24) = 2629575$
	\item Since we have to have at least one of each kind we can just start by assuming we have
          already picked one of each kind, leaving us with $4$ bagels that we can choose any
          way we like. We can then use Theorem 2 again to get $C(8+4-1,4) = 330$
	\item Start by assuming we already picked three egg bagels. That leaves us with $9$ bagels
          that we can choose but we can pick at most two salty bagels so we will sum over the
          possible amount of salty bagels we pick and use Theorem 2 again
          \[ C(7+9-1, 9) + C(7+8-1, 8) + C(7+7-1, 7) = 9724 \]
\end{enumerate}
