\problem{15}
Show that $\binom{n}{k} \leq 2^n$ for all positive integers $n$ and all integers $k$ with $0 \leq k \leq n$.

\solution
%Choosing $k$ items from $n$ can be interpreted as looking at the items one-by-one and making a choice between selecting it or not until you have selected $k$ items. At most you make this choice $n$ times, ...
\[
	\binom{n}{k} \leq \sum_{i=0}^n\binom{n}{i} = 2^n
\]
by Corollary 1.
