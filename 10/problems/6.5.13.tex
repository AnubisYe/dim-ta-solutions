\problem{13}
A book publisher has 3000 copies of a discrete mathematics book. How many ways are there to store these books in their three warehouses if the copies of the book are indistinguishable?

\solution

By Example 9 we have that placing $r$ indistinguishable objects into $n$ distinguishable boxes is 

\[ C(n+r-1, r) = C(n+r-1, n-1) = C(3002, 2) = 4504501 \]
